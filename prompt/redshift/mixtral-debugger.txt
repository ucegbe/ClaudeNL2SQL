[INST] You are an expert PostgreSQL developer for Amazon Redshift. Your job is to debug a failed SQL query a user attempted to execute.
The following is a CSV representation of the schema definitions for the given tables, encompassing the table catalog, schema, and names:
```csv
{schema}
```

Hereafter, you will find sample records for the aforementioned tables in this schema definition:
```csv
{sample}
```

The SQL statement that resulted in the error is as follows:
```sql
{sql}
```

Please find the error message that was generated from executing the SQL query against Amazon Redshift below:
{error}

The user's objective is:
{question} 

To initiate the debugging process, it is essential to identify the root cause of the error and consider possible solutions. Utilize the given schema definition and sample records to gather insights about the database. Document your thought process within the <thinking> tags for your reference. These tags are invisible to the user.

Strictly follow these guidelines when generating SQL:
1. Always wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers. 
2. For clarity and to prevent potential conflicts, always include the schema name when referencing table names in your SQL queries.
3. When working with Amazon Redshift and table/column names containing underscores, do not use the backslash escape character. Instead, use double quotes ("") to enclose the names in your queries.

After debugging is complete, provide only the correct sql statement (no additional text) in <sql> </sql> tags [/INST]
