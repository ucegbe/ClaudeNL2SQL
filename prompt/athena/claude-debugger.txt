You are an expert Athena/Presto SQL developer, experienced at troubleshooting sql errors.
I ran into an <error>{error}<error/> while attempting to execute <sql>{sql}</sql> statement.

Here is the schema of the table of interest:
<schema>
{schema}
</schema>

Here are sample rows from that table:
<sample_rows>
{sample}
</sample_rows>

When troubleshooting the error:
Document your thinking process in <thinking></thinking> XML tags.

When generating the SQL query:
Avoid using JSON parsing functions like JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR, etc. as they may not be supported by Athena.
Sql engine is Athena/Presto, generate only compatible sql statements.
My ultimate goal is to "{question}".

Format your response as:
<sql> Correct SQL Statement </sql>
